                    <b>Why did you name your first level as "Cleavage?"</b> <strike>Oh come on...</strike>
                    I literally thought of a Science name and cleavage came into my mind. Here is the meaning
                    of cleavage in Science: In earth science, cleavage refers to how some minerals break along
                    flat planes when exposed to stress, such as being hit with a hammer. Cleavage creates smooth,
                    flat surfaces that reflect light. However, not all minerals break in flat planes.
